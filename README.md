# BinaryTrees

Project from my first year at FHTW. This program checks if a given binary trees is an AVL-tree and return statistical data.

## Usage

Execute avlTree.exe, enter txt filename.


## How it works
The program reads integers from specified txt file und builds up a binary tree with those values. Multiple values will be ignored.
With recursive functions the tree is then checked if it fulfills AVL-tree conditions. 

Output
* Node which violates AVL-condition
* Statistical data of tree
